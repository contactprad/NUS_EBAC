# How to setup Python for Data Science

My company relies heavily on Python for Machine learning and other data analytics problems. Hence it is an important factor for me to try 
out assignments using Python too. Hence I am creating this repo for maitaining my work. 
My project group is welcom to submit their work here as well. :-)

Below I am explaining the simple steps to get started with Python:
1. Install Anaconda from this [link](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). I preferred to install Python 2.7 based 64 bit version for Windows
2. Install Rodeo IDE from [here](https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo)
Yipeee! you are just ready to start working in Python :-)

# About Anaconda
Anaconda is the leading open data science platform powered by Python. 
The open source version of Anaconda is a high performance distribution of Python and R and includes over 100 of the most popular Python, R and Scala packages for data science.

# About Rodeo IDE
If you working in R Studio, you won't miss anything if you are working in Rodeo IDE for python based code. Although not as powerful as R studio
may be, but it's decent enough to get you started

# Working on your first script
1. If you are on Windows, just go to start menu and search Rodeo
2. Launch Rodeo
3. Write your first script as below:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

#this is a comment in Python
df_new.a = df_new.a.apply(lambda x: x*100)
df_new = pd.DataFrame({"a":np.random.rand(100), "b":np.random.rand(100)})
df_new.head()
```
That's it. You are ready to start!
